# Smart-Garden-Bed
### Objective: 
Over the weekend I spent time with my mother and noticed she had a garden bed. On one side of it she was growing chamomile. Now, she has a little experience gardening but was not sure when was the right time to harvest it. This is how I arrived at this project with the goal to create a smart agriculture system to monitor conditions, and provide data from the garden bed.
### Problem Itâ€™s Tackling: 
Gardening methods often rely on guesswork and experience to determine a plant's needs. I am trying to address this by providing accurate data to eliminate guesswork, and  ensure plants receive the right amount of  water, nutrients, and best time to harvest.

This cost-effective solution is designed to be scalable and can be enhanced with additional features such as automation and remote monitoring. The initial setup focuses on simplicity and manual control, providing a solid foundation for future expansion.
